## Folder Structure


The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `csv`: holds all the csv files and their paths
- `reports`: contains all the reports and video of the project

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
